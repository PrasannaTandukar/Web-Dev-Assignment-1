				<h2>Module Experience</h2>
				<p>At the start of the module, I learned the basics of git and github. I created a new repository and learned the concept of git clone, add, commit, push and pull. I understood the concept of version control systems and how those systems work. I learned the importance of using VCS like github. It gives us the features of having a backup of the code, having the ability to restore older versions of our code and also work our code with multiple developers together.</p>
				<p>I learned about the basics of HTML and CSS. Different HTML tags were introduced and their definitions were taught. I learned about single and paired HTML tags. I also learned basic properties of CSS like fonts, text sizes, colors, background, margin, padding, etc. I also learned how to write CSS by inline, internal or external method. I also did the exercise provided on the module. It helped me to apply the knowledge practically. I also learned to use developer tools and inspect elements on the website.</p>
				<p>I really liked learning the layout and positioning properties in CSS. This gave me a higher control in styling websites. Learning about flexbox and grid was very interesting. These properties gave me the ability to design the layout of website easily. Also learning about responsive web design and using media queries to create a responsive website was also very interesting. I really liked creating a responsive website which worked across all screen sizes. Different modern website design practices were also taught in the module which gave me an idea of creating a modern looking website.</p>
				<p>I really liked the web development module. The module covered many aspects of HTML and CSS from basic to advanced. Furthermore, working with various projects provided by the module helped in further understanding of the topic. The lecutre and tutorial classes were really good.</p>
